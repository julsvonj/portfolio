                            Julija was among the best students that I had the opportunity to teach, she is a great listener and she understands <br> complex issues and new information very quickly. She was one of very few students that understood and started to <br> adopt the agile mindset and her design thinking skills are also very good. Based on her activity and engagement on <br> the classes, tasks and projects I believe she shows great potential and will be a valuable and highly skilled UX <br> Designer. She has great communication skills in addition to a balanced set of soft and hard skills and a very <br> positive personality.</p>

                            During our time at Brainsterâ€™s UX UI Academy I had the opportunity to work with Julija on one of the largest projects we had and at the same time, the one that we had the shortest deadline for. 
First of all, I should note that because of the potential and skill mastering she has shown at the academy she was one of my top choices when choosing teammates, and I am glad I did. 
Not only that she brings a high level of knowledge and work ethic, but she is also responsible for creating a balanced harmonious work environment. One of her strongest skills when working is her ability to take a step back, analyze, give and receive feedback, reflect and apply everything to better the design.</p>

                            Having worked with Julia on two projects during our studies I can confidently say that Julia is a passionate, eager to learn UX Designer who is constantly looking to improve her skills. Welcoming feedback and working hard even after school hours she always makes sure to give 110%. With a broad experience in different companies and an eye for detail, I believe Julia will make an excellent UX Designer in whatever team she's in.</p>
