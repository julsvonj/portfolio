                            The project naturally started with a brief from our client. We conducted a stakeholder interview in which we determined the must have funcionalities for the page and the primary user persona - which are HR reps for it related companies. This page is a personalized URL, which the client sends, after the company in question sends them a request what they expect from a candidate. The clients additionally want to send another URL, once every 3-6 months with exceptional students called - The Super Talent Market, with all the students who showed the best results during the academy.

                    <div class="col-lg-12  d-flex justify-content-center mb-lg-80">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/cs-2.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 mb-lg-80">
                        <h4 class="bold-text mb-lg-4">The process</h4>
                        <p class="p-content">
                            We started first with analyzing the existing page, and determining the main obstacles with the current one to start working on the re-design. The main problem is the big header and the need to clean up the cards of the suitable students. Afterwards I researched competitors and did a detailed competitor analysis. From the research and analysis I concluded that we need to work on a clean, easy to use design, since the HR reps and recruiters have pretty busy schedules, and need to go in find and filter the informations quickly. Old design:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12  d-flex justify-content-center mb-lg-80">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/c3.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 mb-lg-80">
                        <h4 class="bold-text mb-lg-4">The Product</h4>
                        <p class="p-content">
                            Following our research, we firstly finished up with the wireframes, afterwards we choose the colors of Brainster for the talent page. To give the companies a personal touch we added their logo on the left, to let them know that this URL, this product, is worked out and planned special for them and their needs. On the Super Talent page, we decided to go with a bigger hero section - in Brainster style, taking inspiration from the dream team articles they use. We still kept the clean look of the cards so the reps can easily access all the needed information about the candidates. We chose a purple color for this section to give a kind of richness to the page. Since purple  does not often occur in nature, and it is strongly associated with royalty, it makes sense to showcase the best of the best with the backround, and give the extra wow- factor. After the re-design:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12  d-flex justify-content-center mb-lg-80">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/cs1-4.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 mb-lg-80">
                        <h4 class="bold-text mb-lg-4">The Lesson</h4>
                        <p class="p-content">
                            After presenting the finished product, having worked in a team for the first time on a real project, I learned a lot about myself, as well as about design principles. The biggest lesson would be that the saying – “Less is more” does not always apply. Meaning, we were so focused on making the cards simple, that we cut out a lot of information, which could make one candidate possibly stand out.
